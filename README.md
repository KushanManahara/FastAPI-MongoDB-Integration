# üöÄ FastAPI MongoDB Integration

This project implements a RESTful API for managing products and purchases using FastAPI, with data storage and retrieval handled by MongoDB Atlas Data API. It includes endpoints for CRUD operations on products, adding purchases with customer data, and integrating with MongoDB for data storage.


## üöÄ Features

- **Product Management:** Add, retrieve, update, and delete products.
- **Purchase Tracking:** Add purchases with customer data and update customer records.
- **MongoDB Integration:** Utilizes MongoDB Atlas Data API for database operations.
- **FastAPI Framework:** Built using FastAPI, a modern web framework for building APIs with Python.
